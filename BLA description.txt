The Basic Line Algorithm (BLA) is the simplest technique for drawing a straight line on a raster display.
It works by using the mathematical line equation to calculate intermediate points between two endpoints.
While BLA is easy to understand and useful for learning the basics of line generation in computer graphics, 
it is not efficient for practical applications due to its use of floating-point calculations and lower accuracy.
Therefore, more optimized algorithms like DDA and Bresenham’s Line Algorithm are preferred in real-world graphics systems.
